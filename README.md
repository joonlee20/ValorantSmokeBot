# ValorantSmokeBot

## Background

Valorant is a new game pitting one team of five players against another team of five. The attackers are trying to plant a spike which will detonate, whereas the defenders are trying to prevent this or defuse the spike once it has been planted. 

One key ability that players can use is a smoke, which can block a line of sight. This is a simple attempt to calculate the best location to smoke, given an image of the map that has a friendly player's location and a potential enemy player's location. I chose to wrap this into a Discord application, so that Valorant players could easily send an image along with a command in Discord (which many gamers use) and receive an image back with the desired smoke location.
